At Jupiter Bot, we strive to provide reliable and high-quality services to our users. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which refunds may be issued. By using Jupiter Bot, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this policy.  

No Refund Policy: 
Refunds for payments made to Jupiter Bot are generally not available. This includes payments for premium features, subscriptions, or other services provided by the bot.  

Refunds may be considered in exceptional circumstances caused by a failure on our part. The decision to grant a refund is solely at the discretion of the Jupiter Bot team and is subject to the following conditions:   
Jupiter Bot has been offline for three (7) consecutive days or longer due to server issues or other internal failures.  
A core function of Jupiter Bot (e.g., anti-nuke protections, or premium features) has not worked as intended for an extended period, rendering the service unusable.  
The issue must be directly attributable to a failure on our servers or systems, not external factors (e.g., Discord platform issues or misconfiguration by the user).  
 
To request a refund, the following criteria must be met:  
You must provide clear evidence of the issue, including dates, details of the malfunction, and any relevant screenshots or logs.  
The issue must be reported to our support team within 7 days of its occurrence.  
You must cooperate with our support team to resolve the issue before requesting a refund.  

If your request is deemed eligible:  
Our team will review your case and decide if a refund is warranted. This process may take up to 3-4 business days.  
Approved refunds will be issued to the original payment method used for the transaction.  

Refunds will not be issued for the following:  
User misconfiguration or errors in setting up the bot.  
Issues caused by third-party services, including Discord outages.  
Dissatisfaction with the service without valid grounds as outlined in the exceptions above.  
Refund requests for payments older than 30 days.
