A core function of Jupiter Bot (e.g., anti-nuke protections or premium features) has not worked as intended for an extended period, rendering the service unusable.
The issue must be directly attributable to a failure on our servers or systems, not external factors (e.g., Discord platform issues or misconfiguration by the user).

You must provide clear evidence of the issue, including dates, details of the malfunction, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
